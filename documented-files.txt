Server - entry point: Server.java

I didn't document what I found repetitive so not all methods/class variables
are documented in the following files.

All files under service/ and entities/ are documented.
However, entities/ ony have class headers since their methods
are mainly just getters/setters. 

./server/services/ AuthenticatedClientHandler.java
./server/services/ AuthenticatedPayloadProcessor.java
./server/services/ ChannelUpdateHandler.java
