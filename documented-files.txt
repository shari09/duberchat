Server(Shari) - entry point: Server.java

I didn't document what I found repetitive so not all methods/class variables
are documented in the following files.

All files under service/ and entities/ are documented.
However, entities/ ony have class headers since their methods
are mainly just getters/setters. 

./server/services/ AuthenticatedClientHandler.java
./server/services/ AuthenticatedPayloadProcessor.java
./server/services/ ChannelUpdateHandler.java
./server/services/ ClientDisconnectHandler.java
./server/services/ ClientHandler.java
./server/services/ ClientQueue.java
./server/services/ DataService.java
./server/services/ EventQueueService.java
./server/services/ FriendInfoUpdater.java
./server/services/ GlobalServices.java
./server/services/ LoggingHandler.java
./server/services/ LoggingService.java
./server/services/ MessageQueue.java
./server/services/ MessagingService.java
./server/services/ PayloadProcessor.java
./server/services/ PayloadSender.java
./server/services/ SocketService.java
./server/services/ Subscribable.java
./server/services/ TokenService.java
./server/services/ UserService.java


./server/entities/ AuthenticatedClientRequest.java
./server/entities/ Channel.java

./server/entities/ Log.java
./server/entities/ LogEntrySet.java
./server/entities/ PrivateChannel.java
./server/entities/ TokensMap.java
./server/entities/ User.java




None of the gui/ files are documented.


----------------------------------------------------------------
Client(Candice) - entry point: ClientLauncher.java

All files under entities/, resources/, and services/ are documented, with the exception of ./services/GlobalJDialogPrompter.java, which is documented with a header only (I'm sure you wouldn't want to read 700 lines of JDialog anyways...). All gui/ files also have class headers to describe what they do.


Documented files:

./client/entities.ClientSocket.java
./client/entities.ClientSocketListener.java

./client/resources/GlobalClient.java
./client/resources/GlobalPayloadQueue.java

./client/services/ChannelServices.java
./client/services/ClientSocketServices.java
./client/services/UserServices.java

---------------------------------------------------------------
Common:
PayloadType.java - all our payload types are documented
For individual payloads, we only have headers since they are mainly getters and setters, and the parameters are named informatively enough.
